# DeepSeek-V3 ‚Äî Hidden Command Compendium

> These are structured prompt patterns that toggle specific, high-fidelity operating modes. Think of each command as a mini-protocol you can weave into natural language.

---

## Quick-Start

1. Pick a command from the table (e.g., `/output`, `/decide`).
2. Blend it into your prompt as plain text. These aren‚Äôt shell commands; they‚Äôre directives.
3. (Optional) Chain commands for stronger control (e.g., `/reasoning` + `/output`).
4. Reset state with `/unpin all` or by starting a new chat.

## Copy-Paste Starters

**For this reply, use:**

```
/output format: json schema: {"answer":"string","sources":"string[]"}
Question: Summarize the tradeoffs of Rust vs Go for a CLI app.
```

Context to remember:

```
/pin id: project = "Helios compiler"
// Now use project in future answers.
```
Decision helper:
```
/decide options: Postpone, Ship Now, Scope Down
criteria: impact, risk, effort
```
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Model-compatibility note: Some assistants won‚Äôt expose hidden ‚Äúchain-of-thought.‚Äù When you request deep reasoning (e.g., /introspect, /reasoning), they may return a concise self-check or brief rationale rather than internal step-by-step logs.

Notes

Invocation: Use commands as natural-language directives.
Example: ‚ÄúFor the next reply, use /output format: json and keep answers under 120 words.‚Äù

Persistence: Commands such as /pin and /persona are session-scoped. A refresh or new chat resets them.

Combination: The real power is in chaining. For instance, /reasoning + /output format: json yields a machine-readable rationale.

Compatibility: Many assistants summarize internal reasoning rather than expose raw step-by-step thoughts. Expect concise justifications, confidence notes, or bullet-pointed checks instead of verbatim logs.
